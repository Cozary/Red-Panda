# Red Panda

Looking for a Mod that adds the adorable Red Panda? Well here it is.
They are animals that appear in the jungle. They love to eat bamboo so if they see it they will go straight to it to eat it.
Aside from bamboo, they love to eat eggs and sweet berries. You can make friends with them by feeding them that food, but they will not follow you, instead they will cling to your shoulder.
